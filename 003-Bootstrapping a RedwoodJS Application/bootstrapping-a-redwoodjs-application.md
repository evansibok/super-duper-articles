## What is RedwoodJS?
According to its [documentation](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/introduction), Redwood is an opinionated, full-stack, serverless web application framework that will allow you to build and deploy JAMstack applications with ease.

### Understanding what RwJS is and why you should adopt it
Redwood is integrated with technologies like React, GraphQL, custom Auth and a couple of other tools out of the box.

Redwood aims to empower you to focus on building what matters without focusing your energy on choosing technologies or tooling that delay development.

### The features and capabilities of RwJS
Here are some of the features of Redwood:
- Redwood is open source ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Standard file structure to support seamless backend and frontend development
- Automatic page-based code-splitting (similar to Gatsby, NextJS)
- GraphQL Api construction without the need for a boilerplate
- Dynamic data-fetching from the Api on the frontend
- Generators for your frontend application (saves a lot of time)
- Easy deployments to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Render](https://render.com/) and [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) üòç
- Continuous feature upgrades over-time üî•
