## Quick Summary

In our __[previous post](../003-Bootstrapping%20a%20RedwoodJS%20Application/bootstrapping-a-redwoodjs-application.md)__, we learnt how to bootstrap a redwood app from scratch, continuing from there, in this tutorial we are going to learn how to add a Postgres database using Heroku and Generate models for our journaling application using Prisma and Redwood generators.

## Goal

At the end of this tutorial, you will learn how to provision a Heroku Postgres Database, connect the database to our Redwood app, generate GraphQL schemas and the logic needed to perform CRUD operations for all our models.

## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/), every other thing will be taught.

## Creating our Postgres Database on ElephantSQL
<!-- Heroku is a Platform-as-a-service tool for building and managing your application infrastructure in the cloud. You can host your apps on Heroku and get a live url to access them.

Heroku also has other tools like `Heroku Postgres` which is a cloud-managed postgres database service. This is where we'll create our database for this app.

If you don't already have an account on Heroku, head on to [Heroku Website](https://www.heroku.com/) and create one. Then log in to your account and you'll be taken to your dashboard, which looks something like this:

ElephantSQL is a PostgreSQL-as-a-service platform. You can set up a cloud postgres database in about 3 minutes. It's pretty straight forward.

Head over to [ElephantSQL Website](https://www.elephantsql.com/) to create an account and login to start creating our database.

Once logged in, your dashboard should look something like this:

Follow the steps below to create a Postgres Database.

- Click on the __`Create New Instance`__ button
![create new instance](images/create-new-instance.png)

- Enter a name for your database and click the __`Select Region`__ button
![name database](images/name-database.png)

- Select your region (I typically leave it at the default AWS selection) and click the __`Review`__ button
![select region](images/select-region.png)

- Review your selection to ensure you have the right configuration, then click the __`Create Instance`__ button to continue

- Your database will be created and you'll be redirected back to your dashboard ðŸŽ‰

- To get our DATABASE URL, click on the database name in the dashboard and you'll be taken to the database console. _Notice the URL shown in our console as we'll copy and paste it in our Redwood app in the next step._
